EXPLORE

Intro
Python - imperative language; you explicitly tell the computer what to do
HTML, CSS - declarative languages; declare what you want (like a p tag), and the web browser figures it out

Python to start py interpreter
exit() to exit py interpreter

Strings
Double or single; double is convention
Can use Len

Six commonalities of modern programming languages (e.g. Python, JS< C++, Java, LOLCODE)
- store value in variable
- change value of variable
- tell comp to do stuff
- tell comp to do something if true
- use dot (.) to tell objects to do stuff
- how to do same thing repeatedly

Variables
BOXES that hold one value (even a list) at a time
Are programming language's memory
Set variable to a value / assign value to a variable
Can't use variable that doesn't exist
Only use uppercase
Use underscores instead of spaces
Case sensitive

Functions
Tell computer to do stuff via invoking/calling a function
Need name, values to send to function, and parentheses
Have return values (after function/job is complete
Answer = int("34") ... where int("34") returns int 34 and is then stored in variable answer
Take arguments, return return values

Objects
Object attributes represented by a dot
A dot can tell the object to do stuff
Functions used after dots are called "methods" (e.g. append method)

Loops
Nested for loops (put candy in bucket 3 times for kid in kids)

Arguments
Values given to a function (passed into a function)

Conditionals
False
Empty string
0 integer
If ____:
Elif ____:
Else:
Can have many Elifs or no Elifs NOR else clauses

Lists
Contain zero or more values
Are one thing, so you can assign them to variables because variables can hold one thing
Are ordered
Are objects (unlike integers and strings) ... it can DO things, like get bigger (append)
Can use Len
Type of collection
Crash comp by increasing size of list forever on loop
Don't modify a list as you're looping over it

CLASS

QUESTIONS 
why thonny?
If True??

TO DO
Reorganize folders!!

If want to use both quotations, need to escape with a /
Python instance
Ctrl L to clear during python instance/python terminal; clear when in general terminal

"IDE" - integrated development environment

Input method - let's computer pause and take input from user; ALWAYS returned as string without typecasting ... all values must be concetanated as a string .. if using comma, does not need to be string

__pycache__/ = python is converted into byte code and then compiled ... want git to ignore it because will change every time you compile ... make a file called .gitignore - put file names (e.g. __pycache__) in the file
SyntaxError - file can't compile

ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange... 8-bit ... used originally because murica... needed more character sets THUS
Unicode - all characters for every possible language, including emojis, etc.; backwards compatible with ASCII (ASCII codes are in Unicode) ... 64-bit = can store way more characters
Can write up an emoji, send it in with a proposal, paperwork, unicode committee, etc.

## Tuple ##
# another kind of list in python
# list is mutable, tuple is immutable -- mutable = changeable
# tuples are immutable lists
# use paranthese instead of square brackets

Django
Framework that ties py, html, css together to make dynamic, data-driven websites

Docs
Signature
Parameters
Return
Function's signature - shows name of function and all different args that can go into it... placeholders are called function parameters ... args when function is called, parameters when reading about the function
Parameters - in square brackets = optional, if not included - "prompt is written to standard output"
, return
Presence of >>> implies to do using Python interpreter (in terminal)
Int -- Base=10 means base has a default value of 10, int("10",base=2) or int() works ... 10 = unnamed parameter (has no name) and 2 is named parameter (because it has name base) ... means you want to convert "10" as if it were the binary representation of a number
Print -- *objects = will take zero to however many you want number of arguments, params = sep, end, file (standard is sys.stdout=terminal), flush (print things in chunks or immediately); has no return value

Functions
Def, space, name of func, (parameter list): lines of code when function is invoked
# code organization; refactoring - organizing into functions without changing what the program is running
To refactor - start from bottom and move backwards, look at what variables are USED (parameter) and CREATED
Variables inside a function are only alive INSIDE the function (when called, too!)
* = splat, not asterisk -- any number of unnamed args
** = double splat... something to do with dictionaries??

Modules
Module = code in other places = cp;;section of code you can use if you import it
Import ____, from dir import ____ ... ___ = module
datetime contains functions to work with dates, times, and date/times
pprint to print lists and dictionaries in a pretty way rather than the normal way that print does it
os to get information about the operating system
sys to get information about the computer system and the Python version
Modules contain code (functions, etc)

Virtual environment
Package - collection of modules you can install from PyPi; to do that, use the Package Installer for Python (aka pip)
Pip comes with python - official installer for py packages
Pip install package_name
Want to install only in virtual environments 
python -m venv ./.venv -- creates VE in local subdirectory named .venv (add the . So it's hidden by convention... not necessary)
python -m venv ./burrito - could type this
VE for each project 
Must activate VE 
source ./.venv/bin/activate to activate VE ... virtual environment is activated when you see "(.venv)" in front of your terminal prompt
deactivate -- to deactivate VE

CLASS NOTES

Functions
7 parts
Def - tells we're getting ready to define a function
<space> - required after def, so py interpreter knows
<function_name> - name of function, want it to be readable
( - represents start of parameter list
<parameter> - parameters = placeholder, variable waiting to be filled with something

If name function same as built-in, can no longer use built-in function

For Loops
Only good if we know (1) exactly how many times we want to loop and (2) have a collection to loop over

Fork a repo
copying the current state of the repository to your own copy on GitLab; how open software works

For now, don't def functions inside for loop

Functions help manage complexity

Operators are left-right associative, but assignment is right-left associative (will first look at right side)

Call stack - every time you call a function, it gets a new frame on the call stack
Stack frame

Import
# .py not needed ... import rectangle creates an object, and everything in that object can be accessed with dot operator

__init__.py
# dunder file
# required for python to know this folder contains modules ("package", "library")
"Dunder init ... it's going to import the module from it"
Built a library of code to use with shapes

QUESTION - is shapes.rectangle equivalent to dot operator? -- # dot operator = accessing an object (module) within an object (dir)
QUESTION - is there a way to only import one function from a module when importing using the directory.module syntax? -- rename ("as ___")

Pylance is an extension for Visual Studio Code. More specifically, Pylance is a Python language server â€” this means it offers enhancements to IntelliSense, syntax highlighting, package import resolution, and a myriad of other features for an improved development experience in the Python language (tells you when you don't use what you've imported)

# could do sys.path.append(), but that's bad practice ... add one if you don't have it in that path ANOTHER way (will be covered later)
# cmd on mac or alt on pc and hover-click on function from module to see its code

$ doc string = """ asdlksaj """ -- documentation string for this function when FIRST line of function (i.e. what does this function do), then, in VS code, if you hover over the called functions, you see the documentation
""" Used for multiline string, too 


VE
Python virtual environments only change sys.path
Root project = parent directory for that project
Do VE in root
Python -m venv <directory name> (-m means module) - runs like cmd line program, give name of directory you want to store your VE in

source ./.venv/bin/activate
Deactivate
Pip install ___
Pip list - shows packages installed within VE
Pip freeze - lists all packages with version -- want to save this into file called requirements
Pip freeze > requirements.txt
Pip install --help 

Docs
Because int is the class of the value currently stored in the variable, i.e. 785 is a whole number.
Because a value of class str, or string, is now stored in number.
In py, enter help() or help > for (for help on for loop); type q to exit

Dictionaries
Data types = simple (primitive) OR complex (structured)
SImple = int, str, bool, None
Dict = key-value pairs
Dictionaries have "entries" or "key-value pairs"
Unlike a list, the order of those keys coming out of the dictionary is not guaranteed to be the same every time. You cannot rely on it.
If you need order in your sequence, you have to use a list.
Lists and dicts = data structures

Logical expressions
Comparison operators - >, <, >=, <=, !=, ==; evaluate the value of operands on either side of the operator

Identity operators 
Is is not
Check whether operands are identical (when values are stored in exact same memory location -- best practice to use with variables) - is, is not
To compare None, must use "is"
Variables = names that contain where a value is stored in memory; can check location of value with built-in id() function
Variables created that are equated to same number? Point to same location memory! ****
Same lists, tuples do NOT same memory location

Logical operators
And or not

a	b	a and b	a or b	not a
False	False	False	False	True
False	True	False	True	True
True	False	False	True	False
True	False	False	True	False

Truthy: Expressions evaluated as Truth
Falsey: Expressions evaluated as False

bool(0) == False
bool(None) == false
bool([]) == false

Functions, revisited
Functions make our code more readable, maintainable 
Organizing is called refactoring

Scope
Region of code where we can use a variable
Don't have to allocate memory for variables first
Global - Variables defined outside a function

Global scope
Want to write functions that are reusable as possible

Local scope
"Age variable is local to verify_age function"
Variable passed as an argument gets stored in the function parameter ... value is stored in the age parameter

There was some discussion about the is operator last night and how sometimes it shows things like strings and tuples as having the same location in memory, and sometimes they don't.   This has to do with something the python compiler does called "interning".   It's an optimization to make your python programs use less memory.  Usually people mention it when talking about strings... here's an explanation  https://medium.com/techtofreedom/string-interning-in-python-a-hidden-gem-that-makes-your-code-faster-9be71c7a5f3e   But it also happens with anything in python that is IMMUTABLE.  Also, when running in pdb (the python debugger) they will never have the same memory location, because in the debugger INTERNING doesn't happen. This also applies to Thonny when stepping through code a line at a time (it's using the same mechanisms as pdb under the hood)

BTW, the TL;DR of this is... Try not to write code that uses the is operator, especially when comparing strings or tuples.

Conditionals
Words to watch out for: if then, when, only, otherwise, except
Elif only checks if first condition is false
Else not required nor "best practice" 

CLASS
For and while
For = known number of times
While - unknown number of times
Word indicators - every, each, for, all
List and collections (known interaction count) word indicators - find, sort, transform/map (double all numbers in the list ... best practice to return new list), filter (only small numbers ... always returns new list because of diff length) --- find only ever returns ONE thing (often the first), filter returns a collection of things
Unknown iteration count word indicators - until, while, "count number of times ____ in list"
Mapping = transforming data
# reduce -- loop through a list and reduce it down to a single value (e.g. count)
# turn object into something you can see by passing it into the tuple or list constructor
# unpacking - taking a list and other side of =, putting ",,," ... number of values to unpack must be the same
QUESTION -- unpacking??
QUESTION -- transforming, mapping??

Dictionaries
# unordered collection of key-value pairs (but python updated that and now the order matters)
# can create empty dict with {}
# {'key': value} is a "dictionary literal"
# .get() for key that doesn't exist returns None .. won't crash, so a lil safer
# dict['key'] for key that doesn't exist RAISES a KeyError
# Can loop through a list with for; By default, this gives keys
# This is like enumerate but for dicts, gives keys and values
print(me.items())
Dict - both key and value? .items()

Need to fork repos so you have a copy on your own account (fork on the remote server)... like the equivalent of clone just within the remote server, though


FORK, VE, PIP
Click that "Fork project" button!

clone your fork of the the Python Practice Problems repository. Once you get it cloned, do the normal stuff.

Change your working directory to the python-practice-problems directory

Add the original repo as upstream git remote add upstream https://gitlab.com/sjp19-public-resources/python-practice-problems

Create your virtual environment for that directory

python -m venv .venv
Activate your virtual environment

Upgrade pip with

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
Install the requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a work branch (and check it out), first-pass is the branch name

git checkout -b first-pass (creates new branch)
Git checkout first-pass (or main ... navigates to different branch)
Git branch to see all local branches
Git branch -r to see all remote branches

Spend time each day to work on practice problems


Identifying functions
Functions do things - calculate a thing, get some data
Query db 
Return data as native python data to make it processable by python
Len method

Objects and classes
Object oriented programming - style of programming the py supports
